            <p>
                I'm a designer that fully believes in Lean UX principals. I push for meaningful cross-functional communication, and work closely with developers to release products fast and early to pivot on user feedback. My preference is to use a flexible toolset that makes sense for the job at hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                I excel as an early-stage product designer, but also love helping out with product strategy and front-end development. I'm passionate about creating enjoyable experiences that are not cumbersome or distracting, and strive to design interfaces that are intuitive to use without requiring conscious thought.

            <p>

                Hands down one of my favorite people with whom I've ever had the pleasure of working. Optimism that doesn't quit, a focus on extreme simplicity, and an innate ability to rapidly work through really complex UX problems. His presentation skills and EQ in a group are flawless, he takes and incorporates feedback with aplomb, but stands up for what's right if he doesn't agree.

                In the time I've been a developer and manager, I'm not sure I've bumped into another UX professional with the unique blend of design, branding, user empathy, and technical insight that Travis brings to all of his work. It's the effortless chemistry he has with both business and engineers that has drawn so many people to pursuing a work relationship with him over the years. Travis is deeply principled, ethical, in touch with the modern Web, and capable of digesting the most complex business and user problemsâ€“ making the resulting experience so simple as to seem like it should have been obvious from the start. He is a truly gifted professional and a powerful addition to any seriously product-focused team.
