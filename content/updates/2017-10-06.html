            I'm in love with the <a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/oris-chronoris-date-hands-on">Oris ChronOris Date</a>. It's strikes the perfect balance between subtlety and uniqueness. I also find it refreshing that it has a 39mm case, and 43mm lug to lug. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOVrbPHWbLY">video overview</a> from Worn and Wound.
