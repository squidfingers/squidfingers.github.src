<p>Back when I had a little more time, I use to like to create multi-colored linocuts. I really loved carving for days, not being able to see the results until the first print. Some day I'd like to get back into that, but in the meantime I've tried to recreate the same techniques digitally. It's not quite as therapeutic, but it is fun drawing in reverse. I've been experimenting with the technique using Lars' favorite cartoons as the subject matter.</p>
