            I'm excited to see an update to <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> has been released for it's 20th anniversary. This book has had a big impact on my thought processes throughout my career. The principals I learned from it, such as DRY, absctration, reuse, and orginzation, are still ingrained in the methods I use to build out Minted's component library.
