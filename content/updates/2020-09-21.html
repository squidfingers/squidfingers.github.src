    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0nkyGU0UuIkLzKsZutXyBu?si=oWX9EAoLR_qTWBUlytVEnw">PETRA</a> by <a href="https://thebuildingmusic.com/#music-section">The Building</a> has been on repeat all day. Such beautiful lyrics that were written during the shadow of a second cancer diagnosis. Unbelievable strength.
</p>
<blockquote>
    look in to the eyes that you hate<br>
    while seeking the path towards change<br>
    treating the worst like a friend<br>
    the loss of what could have been<br>
    sitting by the window looking out<br>
    choosing to speak rather than shout<br>
    to care instead of to curse<br>
    there's no room to make this worse
</blockquote>
